**1. NN_model.py** provides a robust framework to classify samples in an omics dataset using a neural network.

Here's a summary of the code:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and split into amino acid and protein features, then each subset is scaled independently using MinMax scaling to normalize the values between 0 and 1. Labels are encoded into binary format (e.g., 0 for "Control" and 1 for "CRC").
2. Splitting the Data: The data is divided into training and test sets, ensuring balanced class representation in both.
3. Neural Network Model Definition: A simple neural network model is created with three hidden layers, each followed by a dropout layer to reduce overfitting. The final layer has a sigmoid activation function, suited for binary classification, as it outputs a probability.
4. Model Training: The model is compiled with the binary cross-entropy loss function and an optimizer (adam). Early stopping is applied to prevent overfitting by stopping the training if validation loss doesnâ€™t improve after 10 epochs. The model is trained using 80% of the training data, with 20% held out for validation during training.
5. Evaluation and Performance Metrics: The model's accuracy on the test set is calculated and printed. A ROC-AUC curve is plotted based on test set predictions to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with the AUC score indicating the model's performance.


**2. Network-based_NetworkX.ipynb** constructing and visualizing within-omics networks for amino acid and protein data, enabling a network-based integration of omics data.

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The omics data is loaded, and the columns are split into amino acids and protein features.

Within-Omics Network Construction:
Two separate graphs (G_amino for amino acids and G_prot for proteins) are created using the NetworkX library.
For each feature pair in both data types, an edge is added between nodes (features) if their correlation exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 0.7). This step captures high-correlation relationships, indicating potential interactions between features.

Network Visualization:
One of the networks (e.g., the amino acid network) is visualized using Matplotlib and NetworkX.
Nodes represent features, and edges represent high-correlation relationships. Visualizing this network provides insights into the connectivity and potential functional relationships within the omics layer.
